Headline: End-to-End Flow: AI helps you build, test, and ship faster

Body:
- We shipped Flow A through Flow F: end-to-end storyboard workflows with exports to CSV, PDF, and a JSON Pack. The PDF export path is production-ready (built with pdf-lib), and the end-to-end test matrix ensures every path remains healthy. Accessibility and playback-rate coverage are baked in, so users get a friendlier, more reliable developer experience.
- Local try: clone the repo, npm install, npm run dev, then run unit tests (npm test) and end-to-end tests (npm run test:e2e).

Why it matters:
- AI companions can help programmers build, test, and ship more confidently by automating flows and validating outputs end to end.
- A robust export suite makes it easy to share storyboard results in different formats.
